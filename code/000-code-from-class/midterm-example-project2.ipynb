    "## HIV Model Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "  We will examine policy interventation strategies to address and control the spread of HIV in a sexual network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "  Given the heterogeneity of behavior and network effects of sexually-transmitted diseases, this problem requires ABM and network methodology.  Differential equation compartment models will not allow for incomplete or scale-free graph structures or time-varying agent behavior, and so cannot be used.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Processes and Mechanisms of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "   We are primarily interested in how different ranges of the condom subsidy and condom budget affect the proportion of people that are infected with HIV at each time step. Additionally, we are interested in the rate at which HIV infection could increase given increased condom costs. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Implement condom subsidy mechanics\n",
    "  * Implement gossip network to share status\n",
    "  * Vary condom subsidy and gossip network structure\n",
    "  * Observe how number of steps to 50% infected\n",
    "  * Observe the mean and standard deviation of sexual partner degree distribution\n",
    " \n",
    "  To formally describe our model, let's break it down into pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Space\n",
    "  In this model, our space will be a two-dimensional (2D) square grid.  Each grid cell will contain zero or one people.  Edges of the grid will wrap around.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. People\n",
    " In this case, people are the carriers of HIV.  We are modeling them as simply as possible, using only the following properties:\n",
    " \n",
    " ** Properties **\n",
    "   * _is_infected_: is the person infected with HIV?\n",
    "   * _condom_budget_: what is the person's budget for protection?\n",
    "   * _prob_hookup_: what is the probability that a person will want to hookup given contact?\n",
    "   \n",
    "For their step function, agents will perform the following:\n",
    " \n",
    "   * take a unit-distance step in a random direction\n",
    "   * evaluate neighboring cells for any potential people to hookup with\n",
    "   * for each pair, check against _prob_hookup_; if both people sample True, then hookup\n",
    "   * for a hookup, check against _max_budget_ and the global condom cost to see if either partner will purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Institution\n",
    "\n",
    "  A \"public health\" institution will manage the level of subsidy for condoms.  For now, the subsidy level will be set at $t_0$ and constant over model run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. People\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * People will be randomly distributed throughout the grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement.  In the event that an agent has already been placed at the sampled location, we continue drawing a new nandom position until it is unoccupied.\n",
    "  * People will have their ``prob_hookup`` randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  * People will have their ``condom_budget`` randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  * A single person will be selected at random at $t_0$ to have HIV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Insitution\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The public health institution will set a level of subsidy for condoms using a random uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### IV. Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "  Based on the description above, we need the following model parameters:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * ``grid_size``: size of the two-dimensional square grid, i.e., dimension length\n",
    "  * ``num_people``: number of persons to create; must be less than ${grid\\_size}^2$\n",
    "  * ``min_subsidy``, ``max_subsidy``: the lower and upper bounds for the institution's subsidy\n",
    "  * ``min_condom_budget``, ``max_condom_budget``: the lower and upper bounds for initial conditions of people's ``condom_budget``\n",
    "  * ``condom_cost``: cost of a condom; fixed to $1.0$\n",
    "  * ``min_prob_hookup``, ``max_prob_hookup``: the lower and upper bounds for initial conditions of people's ``prob_hookup``\n",
    "  * ``prob_transmit``, ``prob_transmit_condom``: the probability of transmitting the disease without and with a condom"
