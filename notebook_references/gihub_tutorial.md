##Using the GitHub Website

####Create a GitHub Account
1. Using a browser of your preference, navigate to http://www.github.com and create a username and password and then clicking "Sign Up for GitHub"

####Create a New Repository
1. Sign in to your github account at http://www.github.com

2. In the right hand column, next to the label "Your repositories" click the green button with the label "+ New Repository
<div style = text-align:center;>

</div>

3. Type in a name for your repository in the "Repository Name" box. Here, I use cscs-530-github-tutorial (Note: Avoid spaces and upper case letters, this prevents confusion and more work later!). Hint: Name it something unique so you know what the repository is for, a CSCS530 project, perhaps? Enter a description for the repository if you'd like

4. Click "Initialize this repository with a README" and keep all other default options

5. Click "Create Repository" 

####Editing *.md (markdown) Files
1. In your new repository, click the "README.md" link under the section "Initial commit"

2. Click the pen button at the top of the README.md file, to the left of the trash can button to edit the README.md file
<div style = text-align:center;>

</div>

3. Edit the file to your liking, using Github Markdown syntax. See this page for some tips:
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

4. Under the "Commit Changes" box under the markdown page, you can change the "Update README.md" text in the first, shorter (or thinner) box. This is your "commit message" that displays next to your file in the GitHub directory. You can change this commit mesage to anything you'd like, but keep it simple so others know what was changed. Since you are updating the README.md, let's leave it for now. An extended description in the larger text box is optional, so that you can let your collaborators know exactly what you changed into the future

5. Click "Commit changes" to push your changes to your GitHub repository

####Creating *.md (markdown) Files
1. Navigate to the top page of your GitHub repository (where it shows all of the files that you currently have uploaded. For now, it should just be README.md)

2. Click the blue + button next to the name of your GitHub repository
<div style = text-align:center;>
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6100156/6287252/35a3c03e-b8de-11e4-9156-6e77f9c4c41e.png" height=50px</img>
</div>

3. At the top of the page, replace "name your file..." with a file name that ends with .md (so GitHub knows that it is a markdwon). Here, I use test.md

4. Follow steps 3 - 5 in the "Editing *.md Files" section above to edit and commit changes to your new markdown file

####Downloading Individual Files
1. In your new repository, at the front page click "README.md"

2. Right click "Raw" in the upper right hand corner of the README.md section and select "Save link as" -- Save the file to anywhere in your machine. This will download the "raw" (i.e., original) version of the file. This technique is most useful on files that you want to open up "locally" on your machine (i.e., not in a web-browser). Examples include: *.docx, *.ppt, or *.ipynb

</div>

3. Use this technique only when you want individual files from a repository and are not planning to contribute any changes. For contributing changes to a repository, you should clone the repository. See below. 

##Installing the GitHub Client

</div>

3. Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the file. In our case, the file that we just downloaded is named: "GitHub for Mac 199.zip" 

4. Double click "GitHub for Mac 199.zip" -- this will automatically create a new file named "GitHub" in the same folder as your zip file. The icon will look like this
<div style = text-align:center;>
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6100156/6279530/a08a4814-b870-11e4-8c15-39825a82d327.png" height=80px</img>
</div>

5. Double click the new GitHub icon. You may be prompted with a warning that "GitHub" is an application downloaded from the internet. Click "Open" then select "Do Not Move" when the GitHub client asks if you'd like to move the application to your home applications directory (you can do this yourself later)

6.

3. Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the file. In our case, the file that we just downloaded is named: "GitHubSetup.exe" -- The icon will look like this

</div>

4. Right click on the icon and select "Run as Administrator" -- When it prompts you about a security warning, click "Install"

5. GitHub will automatically load once the install is finished. Once the program loads, at the welcome screen, it will request that you enter your GitHub user credentials (i.e., username and password). Enter these, and click "Log in" 

6. Next, at the Configure tab, enter your Name (upper text bar) and E-mail (lower text bar), or leave it at the default values that it sets at (should be something that you entered when you signed up for your GitHub account). Click "Continue"

7. At the next screen, it will say that there were no repositories found, click the blue "Dashboard" word link.
